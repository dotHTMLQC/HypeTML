# Background

Background is a utility class that adds a background color to an element.

## Syntax

Background classes always start with `bg-` followed by some modifiers. For example, `bg-primary` adds the primary color to an element.

The full syntax is this: `bg-[breakpoint]-{color}`

* `breakpoint` is optional and can be one of the following: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`

* `color` is required and can be one of the following: `primary`, `secondary`, `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `teal`, `blue`, `violet`, `magenta`, `pink`, `brown`, `gray`, `black`, `transparent`
