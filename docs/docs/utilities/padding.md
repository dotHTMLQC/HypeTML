# Padding

Padding is a utility class that adds padding to an element.

## Syntax

Padding classes always start with `p-` followed by some modifiers. For example, `p-1` adds padding of `1rem` to an element.

The full syntax is this: `p[direction]-[breakpoint]-{size}`

* `direction` is optional and can be one of the following: `t`, `r`, `b`, `l`, `x`, `y`
* `breakpoint` is optional and can be one of the following: `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`
* `size` is required and can range from `0` to `5`
